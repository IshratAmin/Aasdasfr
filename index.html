						    <h3><b><i>About CodersTrust</i></b></h3><br>
							<p>CodersTrust is the brainchild of Ferdinand Kjærulff. <p><br>

  							<p>As a Captain of the Danish army he served as recovery officer in Iraq – as a recovery. He pioneered a recovery project with the allied forces, bringing internet and e-learning to the citizens of the region in which he was stationed. The project was a massive success and inspired him to eventually create CodersTrust – supported by Danida – with a vision to democratize access to education via the internet on a global scale. </p><br>

  							<p>"We are taking on the ultimate challenge of our generation in achieving something that millions of dollars worth of bombs and military equipment can't do. To create a sustainable peace in freedom by rolling out an inclusive financial system with access to education & the labor market".</p><br>
